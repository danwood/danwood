## Some projects hosted here and others I've built or heavily contributed to:

[PerfectTypist](https://github.com/danwood/PerfectTypist)
: A prototype, based on Apple "CapturingScreenContentInMacOS" sample code, to perform screen capture that automatically repairs typing mistakes.

[CapturingPhotos](https://github.com/danwood/CapturingPhotos)
: Improvements on Apple "Capturing Photos" (SwiftUI iOS camera app) sample code

[SwiftUICoreImage](https://github.com/danwood/SwiftUICoreImage)
: Hundreds of Core Image filters wrapped as CIImage modifiers for easy integration with SwiftUI

[My fork of Periphery](https://github.com/danwood/periphery)
: Periphery is a tool to identify unused code in Swift projects. My fork enhances it to look for code that is more public than it needs to be, in order to encourage encapsulation.

[Remotion Emoji Library & Utilities](https://github.com/Remotionco/Emoji-Library-and-Utilities)
: At Remotion, we needed to present our own custom emoji picker. There wasn't (isn't) a decent API for accessing all emoji available on the system, so we created our own based on several canonical sources.

[iMedia Browser](https://github.com/karelia/iMedia)
: Apple didn't provide an API for third-party apps to browse local media, as Apple's own apps contained. This was an approximate re-creation of this UI, along with hooks for enhancement. Used by several dozen shipping apps!


Most of the rest of the repositories in my account are old projects and probably not of much use to anybody!
